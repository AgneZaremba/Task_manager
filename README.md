#  Task Manager (Python Project)

## Description
**Task Manager** is a simple Python program written in Python that helps you manage your daily tasks. The program allows you to:

- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks with status (❌ Not Done / ✅ Done)  
- Mark tasks as done  
- Delete tasks  
- Visualize task progress in a chart  

Tasks are saved in a **CSV file** (`tasks.csv`), so they remain even after closing the program.
